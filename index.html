                <img src="images/littering.jpg"/>
                <p class="para">More than just laziness, littering is a monumental social injustice too grave to
                    be defined as merely a pet peeve.
                    <a href="http://www.ncdps.gov/es/DPS-Services/Crime-Prevention/Litter-Free-NC/Litter-Facts">Costly time and manpower</a> are necessary to abate the
                unsightly problem. What's hard about picking up after yourself?</p>

                    <h2>Walking Two (or More) Abreast on a Sidewalk</h2>
                </header>
                <img src="images/sidewalkhogs.jpg"/>
               <p class="para">Humans love to travel in packs, and frankly, sidewalks weren't
                designed for us. Even on a generously wide, ADA-compliant sidewalk,
                   <a href=http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/pedestrian_etiquette.phpmore">more than two adults
                       cannot walk side-by-side</a>. It's simple: we have to move into single-file formation
                   on the sidewalk to avoid the dreaded game of "sidewalk chicken."</p>

                <img src="images/backseatdriver.jpg"/>
                <p class="para">As someone who reflexively follows commands, this one is
                    <a href="http://cheapautoinsurance.net/distractions-from-backseat-drivers/">a nightmare</a>. I will obey
                a backseat driver almost without thought, until the angry moment I realize I'm not in
                control of my own vehicle. Dangerous habit.</p>

                <img src="images/overfamiliar.jpg"/>
                <p class="para">While touch is the most grievous offense in this category, I would go so far as to
                proclaim that simple overuse of my first name is downright fresh. I like a nice, stiff,
                formal address, and hands where I can see them.</p>
